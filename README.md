# FitLit

## Overview

FitLit is an activity tracker that helps you monitor various aspects of your daily health and fitness. It tracks data such as your daily step goal, your step goal compared to all other users, your water consumption, your sleep data, and your sleep quality.

## Goals

- Provide users with comprehensive activity tracking.
- Implement Fetch API to pull user data in and display that on the DOM.
- Ensure data accuracy through robust testing.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core logic and functionality, including DOM manipulation.
- **HTML & CSS**: Structure and styling of the application, featuring sleek animations.
- **Fetch API**: Fetches data from external sources.
- **Mocha & Chai**: Testing framework to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## Challenges

- **Fetch API**: Implementing fetch API to retrieve data was new for us. We faced issues with asynchronous data fetching and handling errors effectively.
- **Team Collaboration**: Adapting our working styles to meet benchmarks required constant communication and coordination.
- **Testing**: Ensuring comprehensive test coverage following both happy and sad paths.

## Wins

- Successfully integrated the Fetch API for real-time data fetching.
- Created a user-friendly interface with smooth animations.
- Developed a robust test suite that ensured code reliability.
- Improved team collaboration and project management skills.
